What are some potential problems with machine learning models?

Machine learning modeling can be problematic for learning algorithms due to the ingestion 
of poor quality data. For example, the data may not include enough samples to represent
a sufficiently broad scope of relevant variables.

What are simple and complex models?

Simple and complex ML models differ when balancing a model's accuracy (number of correctly 
predicted data points) and a model's explainability (how much of the ML system can be 
explained in "human terms"). The output of a simple ML model may be explainable and
produce faster results, but the results may be inaccurate. 
The output of a complex ML model may be accurate, but the results may be difficult to communicate.


What is unexplainabilty?

Unexplainability represents how much of the reasoning behind an ML model's 
decision cannot be effectively described in human terms.

What is uncertainty?

Uncertainty describes an imperfect outcome. In the context of machine learning,
uncertainty arises from using models. These models attempt to fit a training data,
which may have imperfect data. The "best" data may also be unknowable.
